Collections framework provides developers with a way to store, manipulate, and access related data in Java applications. It provides developers with means to manipulate data like sorting, searching, and insertion. And just like any other concept, the usage of collections also come with their own best practices and rules, which will be discussed in this module. 

Here are a few best practices to be followed while using Collections.

Choose the right collection
The interface type should be used as a reference type
Generics and diamond<> operator should be used
Iterating using a for-each loop or forEach function
Use of isEmpty() over size() method
Implement Comparable interface fro comparing objects
Overriding equals() and hashcode() methods
The above best practices are followed while implementing Collection are discussed further in detail.
