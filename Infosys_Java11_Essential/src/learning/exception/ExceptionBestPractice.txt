Every application developed in any language will always have one thing in common, that is a way to handle the various exceptions that are thrown during the execution. And just like any other concept in Java, there are certain rules/practices that every developer should follow while handling exceptions to get the best results and performance from the application.

The following are the best practices that will vastly improve the reliability, readability, and maintainability of any application by many folds. 

Throw specific Exceptions rather than generic ones
Proper usage of finally block
Use the catch block only if an exception is supposed to be handled
Give proper exception message when throwing an exception
Include the cause of exception when rethrowing an exception
NullPointerException should never be caught
Let us discuss each best practice in detail.
